## Introduction
This assignment for Discrete Mathematics and Databases (CM12004) at University of Bath was designed to achieve three primary objectives: firstly, to improve understanding of database design using the Entity-Relationship (E-R) model; secondly, to introduce Python programming and SQLite database management; and thirdly, to provide practical experience in creating a small yet impactful database application with Python.

The assignment is to design a Flight database housing essential information about flights, the pilots in charge, and respective destinations. Through the program, users should seamlessly add and modify data according to evolving flight schedules.

Throughout this assignment, the goal is to be familiar with the E-R model and consolidate Python and SQLite skills.
